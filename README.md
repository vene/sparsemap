SparseMAP is a new method for **sparse structured inference,**
able to automatically select only a few global structures:
it is  situated between MAP inference, which picks a single structure, 
and marginal inference, which assigns probability mass to all structures, 
including implausible ones. 

SparseMAP is **differentiable** and can work with any structure for which a MAP
oracle is available.

SparseMAP may be used to dynamically infer the computation graph structure,
marginalizing over a sparse distribution over all possible structures. Navigate 
to the `cpp` folder for an implementation, and see our paper,

## Current state of the codebase

We are working to slowly provide useful implementations. At the moment,
the codebase provides a generic pytorch layer supporting version 0.2,
as well as particular instantiations for sequence, matching, and tree layers.

Dynet custom layers, as well as the SparseMAP loss, are on the way.


## Python Setup

Requirements: numpy, scipy, Cython, pytorch=0.2, and ad3 >= 2.2

1. Set the `AD3_DIR` environment variable to point to the
   [AD3](https://github.com/andre-martins/ad3) source directory.

2. Inside the `python` dir, run  `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`.


### Notes on testing

The implemented layers pass numerical tests. However, the pytorch
gradcheck (as of version 0.2) has a very strict "reentrant" test, which we fail
due to tiny numerical differences. To reliably check gradients, please comment
out the `if not reentrant: ...` part of pytorch's gradcheck.py.

## Dynet (c++) setup:

See the instructions in the `cpp` folder.
